## Description
I used to always forget important things, but then I learned to organize everything by creating a reliable place to store those hard to remember items. Now I'm the most efficient granny around, and I can help you whippersnappers clear your mind-clutter and do the same! **Ethel** is not just an ordinary granny, or an ordinary list making application. Sure, you can create lists, sort them into categories and easily add and remove items, but you can also share lists with other people and collaborate instantly. 

Left your grocery list under the fridge magnet? Mobile-first development means your lists are right at home on your phone, and more importantly always with you. Want to know what items your partner or roommate just picked up from 5 aisles over? Share and work off the same list in the store, in real time. Need a place to share movie recommendations, gift ideas or party planning to-dos? Ethel's got you covered.

## Details and Learnings
- Creating the list actions modal within the context of each list itself rather than the full page allows the user to easily see which list they are acting on and keeps the functionality intuitive. There is a risk with this approach due to the potential size conflict between the user search modal and the list card size, for example if a search for users to share a list returns a large number of results.
- Currently, the user must click Refresh on a shared list to view changes made by other users. Could consider a timed refresh here to make the app appear more dynamic.
- When a list is shared it first lands in the recipient's "Uncategorized" category, allowing them to the Move it to a category of their choice.
- When sharing a list, you cannot duplicate sharing, and lists can only be shared or deleted by their original owner.
- Could refactor to store data in a global context rather than prop drilling list and category information through so many components.

Some considerations for **future development** include:
  - Inclusion of a service worker and local/cache first fetch policies to allow for limited offline use and installation as a PWA.
  - Add functionality to remove or update categories and un-share lists.
  - Ability to sort and pin lists within categories.
  - Search function for lists by keywords/items in list.
  - Be able to add a comment to list items.
  - Reminder functionality.

Thanks for reading. Enjoy The App! And can I interest you in a hard butterscotch candy?
